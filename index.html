			<div id="slushIntro">
				<p>
					SLUSH is Europe's leading startup 
					and technology 
					event, which connects startups and tech talent with top-tier i
					nternational investors, executives, and media. In 2015, 
					SLUSH brought 
					together 15,000 attendees including 1,700 startups, 800 venture 
					capital investors and 630 journalists from exactly 100 countries 
					for the two day event held in Helsinki, Finland. People from more 
					than half of the world's countries traveled to Helsinki, with the 
					ambition of taking their business to the next level.
				</p>
				<p>
					SLUSH is a 
					non-profit event organized by a community of entrepreneurs, 
					investors, students and festival organizers. Although SLUSH 
					has grown from a 300-person event to become one of the leading 
					events of its kind in the world, the philosophy behind it has 
					remained the same: to help the next generation of great, 
					world-conquering 
					companies forward. Know

				Why 
				<br/>
				<strong>SLUSH IN NEPAL?</strong>
			</div>
			<div class="description">
				<p>
					SLUSH acts as a bridge between startups and investors, 
					media and executives. Nepal, now more than ever, is excited 
					about the prospects of booming business that are 
					centered around technology. We have seen instances 
					around the world where technology form the core of 
					business, and successfully so. Lately, Nepal also has 
					shown exciting prospects in this area.
				</p>
				<p> 
					We have start ups and we have established companies with 
					innovative products that are not just nationally significant 
					but also have international prospects. Right now, an opportunity 
					to take these products to international investors is not just 
					less, but nonexistent. SLUSH Nepal could be a pioneer in taking 
					Nepalese products to an important international platform of a 
					huge scale such as SLUSH. YoungInnovations as convener of 
					mobile social networking hub (
					<span class="colorRed">
						www.mobilenepal.net
					</span>
					) is proud 
					to bring this event in Nepal.
